# TaylorFit

TaylorFit is a multivariate polynomial regression application that fits data to
a predictive model consisting of a polynomial function, such as

`f(x, y) = ax + by + cxy`

where `x`, `y`, and `xy` are terms selected by the user, and `a`, `b`, and `c`
are coefficients determined using least squares regression.


## On the Web

The application works entirely client-side in your browser, so there's no need
to download or install anything and no need to create an account. In order to
be reasonably efficient, TaylorFit utilizes specific JavaScript primitives and
browser capabilities that emulate native execution.
