About
---

The source code for this project is written in
coffeescript which is a hll which compiles into js.

The project is split into two fundamental pieces
referenced from here on as the `algorithm` and
the `interface`.

The `algorithm` defines the constrains and functionality
of the project and may be placed within the interface
or on an independent machine.

The `interface` will first target browsers but will be
written with the intention of creating a desktop
and mobile interface as well.
